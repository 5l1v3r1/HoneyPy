# Developers

The core of HoneyPy is a framework that handles configuring and launching services as well as logging. Developers can easily create new service plugin or logging plugin to extend HoneyPy's capability.

Terms:

- Plugin - a service plugin that implements a network protocol (e.g. Telnet, SSH, HTTP, etc). All plugins reside in the `plugins` directory.
- Logger - a logging plugin that sends event data to an external service or SIEM (e.g. Twitter, HoneyDB, Splunk, etc.). All loggers reside in the `loggers` directory.
