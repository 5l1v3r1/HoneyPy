# Welcome to HoneyPy Docs

HoneyPy is a low to medium interaction honeypot framework.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/honeypy/badge/?version=latest)](http://honeypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

HoneyPy is written in Python and is intended to be easy to: deploy, extend funtionality with plugins, and apply custom configurations. The level of interaction is determined by the functionality of a plugin. Plugins can be created to emulate UDP or TCP based services to provide more interaction. All activity is logged to a file by default, but posting honeypot activity to other services can be configured as well.
